# Chatbot3000

A program for simple conversation simulation.
The user can conversate with the program using graphical interface, writting
messages to the chatbot.
The algorithm needs a base file where certain words are associated
with categories and responses.
The algorithm uses Porter stemming algorithm to reduce words from user input to
their stem and looks up csv file to find matching words. It then provides
a randomized response associated with category that has most matching words.
It was made as a project for Computer Programming 4 course 
on Silesian University of Technology.
